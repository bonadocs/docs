  "description": "Actions allow us to interact with our contracts using a JavaScript environment; similar to the front end of an application. Multiple smart contract method calls and transactions are required to complete certain complex actions. For example, executing a Swap action on Uniswap involves at least two calls for most tokens: approve tokens (approve), and execute swap (swapExactTokensForTokens). Actions allow us to complete these kinds of interactions on smart contracts.",
