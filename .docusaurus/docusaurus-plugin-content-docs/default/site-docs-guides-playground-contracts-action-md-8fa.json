  "description": "Actions allows us to interact with our contracts using a JavaScript environment; similar to the frontend of an application. Multiple smart contract method calls and transactions are required to complete certain complex actions. For example, executing a Swap action on Uniswap involves at least two calls for most tokens: approve tokens (approve), execute swap (swapExactTokensForTokens). Actions allows us to complete these kind of interactions on smart contracts.",
