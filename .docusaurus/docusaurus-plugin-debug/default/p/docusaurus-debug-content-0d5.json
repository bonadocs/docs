Multiple smart contract method calls and transactions are required to complete certain complex actions. For example, executing a Swap action on Uniswap involves at least two calls for most tokens: approve tokens (approve), and execute swap (swapExactTokensForTokens). Actions allow us to complete these kinds of interactions on smart contracts.","source":"@site/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Action.md","sourceDirName":"guides/Playground/Contracts","slug":"/guides/Playground/Contracts/Action","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Action","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/bonadocs/docs/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Action.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":2,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":2},"sidebar":"docsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Contract Methods","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods"},"next":{"title":"Variables","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Variables"}},{"id":"guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods","title":"Contract Methods","description":"The most basic way to interact with individual contracts in your playground is through their methods.","source":"@site/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods.md","sourceDirName":"guides/Playground/Contracts","slug":"/guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/bonadocs/docs/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":1,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":1},"sidebar":"docsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Edit Playground","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Edit"},"next":{"title":"Actions","permalink":"/docs/guides/Playground/Contracts/Action"}},{"id":"guides/Playground/Create","title":"Create Playground","description":"The playground creates a \"one-stop shop\" for your protocol.
