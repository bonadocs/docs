We also added more automation to the release publication process, simplified the workflow, and reduced the complexity, we believe this change will help us add more important that may be hard to do in the old release model.\\n\\nIn the future we look forward to applying this release model to all of NeXT Panel projects, but with a more traditional semantic versioning scheme instead of release year-based rolling versioning."}]}}')}}]);
