Multiple smart contract method calls and transactions are required to complete certain complex actions. For example, executing a Swap action on Uniswap involves at least two calls for most tokens: approve tokens (approve), and execute swap (swapExactTokensForTokens). Actions allow us to complete these kinds of interactions on smart contracts.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods":{"id":"guides/Playground/Contracts/Contract-methods","title":"Contract Methods","description":"The most basic way to interact with individual contracts in your playground is through their methods.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"guides/Playground/Create":{"id":"guides/Playground/Create","title":"Create Playground","description":"The playground creates a \\"one-stop shop\\" for your protocol.
