# Documentation

The goal of documenting on bonadocs is to ensure that there's an explanation every step of the way as developers go through your project.
### Project and contract documentation

Once you click `Documentation` on top, you can see the project and contract documentation. The `Project Documentation` can be edited in the [edit modal](/docs/guides/Playground/Edit.md), while the `Contract Documentation` can be edited right there.

### Method documentation

Once a contract `method` is opened, you can see the docs just below the interaction. There's `markdown` that allows you to edit text, and preview that's read-only.

### Action documentation

Similarly, with actions, you can click on `Documentation` which allows you to `read` and `write` the docs.
