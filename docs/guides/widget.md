# Widget

## Introduction
When reading the documentation, the explanation of the protocol contracts is great. However, developers have to setup a basic testing environment to interact with the contracts to better understand the behavior.

The widget eliminates this by enabling developers to interact with the contract methods directly within the documentation. This greatly reduces integration time and the context switching that would otherwise be required, making protocols more developer-friendly.

Bonadocs widget allows you to enable interactivity within your docs through widgets.

## Getting Started
