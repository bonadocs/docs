# Bonadocs Documentation

Bonadocs allows web3 engineering teams to collaborate and build applications in a very intuitive way. To simplify integrations, we've categorized our tooling as follows:

* **Docgen**: Docgen allows developers go from their codebase to a beautiful and interactive documentation in a few seconds. Using our hardhat plugin, you can generate interactive documentation that allows you query your contract methods.
* **Widget**: Through our playground environment, you can generate widgets for your individual contract methods. These widgets can then be easily embedded in your docs or any react application for devs to query. This is instrumental for devrel teams to help onboard external devs.
* **Playground**: Our playground is a collaborative environment primarily for solidity and frontend devs to build applications. This can be used by internal engineering teams or teams across different organizations. Devrel teams can also take advantage of the playground to create a single source of truth for their protocol - making onboarding super easy for their developer community.
* **Protocol Registry**: Our protocol registry is an open source tool that allows you find different popular protocols and their respective playgrounds.

On a high level, bonadocs is created to simplify the documentation, interaction, and integration of smart contracts.
